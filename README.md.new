# Startup AI Agent

An AI-powered agent system that helps job seekers discover newly funded startups before they post job openings. This agent automatically collects data about startups that recently received funding, analyzes their tech stacks and potential hiring needs, and delivers personalized reports to your inbox.

## Quick Start (Docker)

The easiest way to run Venture Watch is using Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vatsinaname/Venture-Watch.git
cd Venture-Watch

# Copy and edit the environment file with your API keys
cp startup_agent/.env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Run using the helper script
# Linux/Mac:
chmod +x docker-start.sh
./docker-start.sh

# Windows (PowerShell):
.\docker-start.ps1
```

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:8501

## Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vatsinaname/Venture-Watch.git
cd Venture-Watch

# Install dependencies
pip install -r startup_agent/requirements.txt

# Install the package (development mode)
python install.py

# Configure your API keys
cp startup_agent/env.example startup_agent/.env
# Edit the .env file with your API keys

# Run the agent
python run.py
```

## Interactive Dashboard

Venture Watch includes an interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploring startup data:

```bash
# Run the dashboard
python -m startup_agent.run_dashboard
```

The dashboard provides:
- Visual analytics of startups by category, tech stack, and funding round
- Detailed company profiles with filtering capabilities
- Export options to PDF and CSV formats
- Interactive data exploration

## Docker Services

The Docker setup includes three services:

1. **Agent** - Collects and processes startup data
2. **Dashboard** - Provides a web interface for exploring data
3. **Scheduler** - Runs the data collection on a defined schedule

All services share a common data volume, so data collected by one service is available to the others.

## Report Formats

Venture Watch supports multiple report formats:

1. **HTML Reports** - Beautiful, formatted emails with startup details
2. **PDF Reports** - Professional PDF documents generated using ReportLab
3. **CSV Export** - Tabular data for further analysis in spreadsheet software

## Project Architecture

This multi-agent system uses LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models to:

1. Collect startup funding data from Crunchbase API
2. Analyze company details to extract tech stack and hiring needs
3. Generate beautiful reports in multiple formats
